 abstract = {The joint determination of work and investment in human capital over the life cycle is analyzed. At low rates of impatience investment is decreasing throughout life, as in simpler models which assume hours of work to be fixed. The demand for leisure over the life cycle is "U shaped." Wages rise to a single peak which occurs after the peak in hours of work. Distinctly different patterns arise when the rate of impatience is high. Such individuals may prefer an increasing hours of work profile, and schooling need not be concentrated at the beginning of life. Conditions are provided to determine a critical level of time preference which is sufficient to induce a "normal" life-cycle pattern for investment and work.},

Estimation results and simulation exercises indicate that the intertemporal elasticity of substitution is much higher than the conventional estimates and the downward bias comes from the omission of the human capital accumulation effect. The human capital accumulation effect renders the life-cycle path of the shadow wage relatively flat, even though wages increase with age. Hence, a rather flat life-cycle labor supply path can be reconciled with a high intertemporal elasticity of substitution.},

We find substantial elasticities for labor supply and particularly for lone mothers. Returns to experience, which are important in determining the longer-term effects of policy, increase with education, but experience mainly accumulates when in full-time employment. Tax credits are welfare improving in the U.K., increase lone-mother labor supply and marginally reduce educational attainment, but the employment effects do not extend beyond the period of eligibility. Marginal increases in tax credits improve welfare more than equally costly increases in income support or tax cuts.},

For concreteness, we focus on two general equilibrium models: the stochastic growth model extended to include some forms of heterogeneity and the overlapping generations model enriched to accommodate human capital formation."

A key feature of our model is a nonlinear mapping from hours worked to labor services. This gives rise to an endogenous workweek that can differ across occupations. The theory determines what fraction of the lifetime an individual works, not when. We find that constraints on workweek length have different consequences for total hours than for total labor services. Also, we find that policies designed to increase the length of the working life may not increase aggregate lifetime labor supply."

The method of simulated moments is used to match the life cycle profiles of labour force participation, hours worked, and assets that are estimated from the data to those that are generated by the model. The model establishes that the tax structure of the Social Security system and pensions are key determinants of the high observed job exit rates at ages 62 and 65. Removing the tax wedge embedded in the Social Security earnings test for individuals aged 65 and older would delay job exit by almost one year. By contrast, Social Security benefit levels, health, and borrowing constraints are less important determinants of job exit at older ages. For example, reducing Social Security benefits by 20 would cause workers to delay exit from the labour force by only three months.}",

Using data from the Health and Retirement Study, we estimate a dynamic programming model of retirement that accounts for both saving and uncertain medical expenses. Our results suggest that Medicare is important for understanding retirement behavior, and that uncertainty and saving are both important for understanding the labor supply responses to Medicare. Half the value placed by a typical worker on his employer-provided health insurance is the value of reduced medical expense risk. Raising the Medicare eligibility age from 65 to 67 leads individuals to work an additional 0.074 years over ages 60–69. In comparison, eliminating 2 years worth of Social Security benefits increases years of work by 0.076 years.},

 abstract = {This paper provides an empirical analysis of how the U.S. Social Security and Medicare insurance system affects the labor supply of older males in the presence of incomplete markets for loans, annuities, and health insurance. We estimate a dynamic programming (DP) model of the joint labor supply and Social Security acceptance decision, focusing on a sample of males in the low to middle income brackets whose only pension is Social Security. The DP model delivers a rich set of predictions about the dynamics of retirement behavior, and comparisons of actual vs. predicted behavior show that the DP model is able to account for a wide variety of phenomena observed in the data, including the pronounced peaks in the distribution of retirement ages at 62 and 65 (the ages of early and normal eligibility for Social Security benefits, respectively). We identify a significant fraction of "health insurance constrained" individuals who have no form of retiree health insurance other than Medicare, and who can only obtain fairly priced private health insurance via their employer's group health plan. The combination of significant individual risk aversion and a long tailed (Pareto) distribution of health care expenditures implies that there is a significant "security value" for these individuals to remain employed until they are eligible for Medicare coverage at age 65. Overall, our model suggests that a number of heretofore puzzling aspects of retirement behavior can be viewed as artifacts of particular details of the Social Security rules, whose incentive effects are especially strong for lower income individuals and those who do not have access to fairly priced loans, annuities, and health insurance.},

	title = {Happy Together: A Structural Model of Couples{\textquoteright} Joint Retirement Choices},
	year = {2010},
	abstract = {Evidence from different sources shows that a signicant proportion of spouses retire within less than a year from each other, independently of the age difference between them. The existing reduced- form analyses of couples{\textquoteright} retirement suggest that this is partly due to complementarities in spouses{\textquoteright} tastes for leisure, which are present when one or both partners enjoy retirement more if the other is retired as well. In order to accurately estimate the role of leisure complementarities, it is essential to appropriately control for incentives to joint retirement acting through the household budget con- straint. This paper presents a structural, dynamic model of older couples{\textquoteright} saving and participation decisions which allows for the complementarities in spouses{\textquoteright} leisure and where the nancial incentives and uncertainty facing spouses are carefully modeled. Couples are heterogeneous in household wealth and spouses{\textquoteright} wages, pension claims, and health status. They face uncertainty in earnings, medical costs, and survival. The model parameters are estimated using a sample of older individuals from the Health and Retirement Study. Estimation results show that leisure complementarities are positive for both husband and wife and account for up to 8 percent of observed joint retirements. The social security spousal benefit is found to account for an extra 13 percent of them. These results imply that incentives for joint retirement play a crucial role in determining individual choices. Since these incentives cannot be captured in a model that takes one spouse{\textquoteright}s behavior as exogenous, this sug- gests that individual models of retirement are no longer an appropriate approximation of the average household{\textquoteright}s behavior, given the increasing number of working couples approaching retirement age.},

We find that a suitably extended human capital investment model can in fact do an excellent job of fitting observed data on school attendance, work, occupational choices, and wages in the NLSY data on young men and also produces reasonable forecasts of future work decisions and wage patterns.},
